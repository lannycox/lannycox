## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Lanny, thanks for checking out my profile. 

###  Information Security is my main field of work, though I enjoy learning and writing about all aspects of computing.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: CISSP certification, a few hardware and software projects to pass the time (they'll gradually be posted here once reaching a near-functional state).
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m currently researching: new and interesting ways to contribute to open-source threat intelligence, security-centric topics around distributed systems and quantum computing.
